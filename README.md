Yeah, a really niche tool, whatever. So, it just makes it much simpler to keep track of your vps connections. Just shove them all into a sqlite db located at `~/.ssh/remote_registry.db3` and then later just select the one you want to connect to.

Controls: arrows up/down to select, enter to connect. Dead simple.
